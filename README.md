# hate_speech_twitter
Solution presented in the Hate Speech Twitter competition task at PAN @ CLEF 2021 

# Docker
In order to allow the solution to be executed in the simplest way possible in any operating system distribution (Linux, Windows and macOS), we chose to make the solution available through the docker tool. The docker allows you to create an execution environment where all packages are installed in their correct version, avoiding problems for the end user.
